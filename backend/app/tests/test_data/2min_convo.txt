DOCTOR: Okay, good to see you again. How have things been since our last visit?

PATIENT: Overall… a bit tougher than I expected. You suggested I stop checking my blood pressure every day, and I tried, but I’ve still been doing it more than I should. It’s just been hard to let go of that routine.

DOCTOR: I understand. What’s been making it difficult?

PATIENT: I think it’s that the readings look better than I actually feel. Physically the numbers are fine, but I still feel pretty anxious and kind of… on edge. I’ve been trying to take back some control — getting back to my normal routine — but I don’t think I’m fully ready for everything yet.

DOCTOR: That makes sense. What kinds of things are you trying to take back on?

PATIENT: Cooking, errands, managing the house stuff again. And I keep slipping into this habit of taking care of everyone else. My partner keeps telling me to slow down, but it’s like a reflex. And honestly… I don’t fully trust myself to know what my limit is right now. I feel like there’s only so much I can handle before it becomes too much.

DOCTOR: Thanks for being honest about that. We can work on setting clearer limits and easing back into things at a pace that feels manageable.
