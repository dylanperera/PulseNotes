PATIENT: So… last time you suggested I try not to check my heart rate on my smartwatch every couple of hours, which I agreed with, and I really did try. But honestly, it’s been harder than I expected. I’ve still been checking it more often than I probably should. (pause) It’s weird because the numbers are okay, but I feel more on edge than I thought I would. [00:01:00]

DOCTOR: When you say “on edge,” do you mean physically or more emotionally?

PATIENT: Kind of both. Physically it feels like my chest tightens up, especially in the afternoon. And emotionally I feel… sort of fragile. I keep thinking something’s wrong with my heart even though you told me everything looked normal on the last ECG. (pause) I’ve been trying to get control over my routine again — exercising a bit, managing work — but I don’t think I’m handling the stress as well as I hoped.

DOCTOR: What does the stress usually look like for you during the day?

PATIENT: Work’s been pretty intense lately. Deadlines, long meetings, just a lot of pressure. And when I get home I’m supposed to unplug, but instead I end up trying to take care of everything else — groceries, the kids’ stuff, checking on my parents — and it just stacks up. (pause) I keep slipping into this pattern where I want to take responsibility for everything. And then when my heart feels off or I get that tightness, it throws me right back into worrying. [00:02:00]

DOCTOR: That sounds really draining. What happens when you try to slow down?

PATIENT: That’s the thing. When I actually have a quiet moment, that’s when I get the most anxious. It’s like… when things are chaotic I can just push through, deal with it. But when everything calms down and I’m supposed to relax, that’s when I notice every little sensation in my chest and I go, “Oh no, what if this is something serious?” (pause) Even when my partner tries to help, I end up feeling guilty or irritated, which makes no sense. It’s like the better things get, the less I feel capable of handling them.

DOCTOR: That’s a very common pattern when stress builds up for a long time. What else has been triggering this heart awareness?

PATIENT: My mom’s health, for sure. She’s been hinting that she might need more help soon, and I’ve been carrying that around. And at work, everyone keeps saying I need to “protect my heart” because of the stress, and that freaks me out even more. (short pause) I know they mean well, but every time someone says something like that, I feel like I’m doing something wrong with my body. [00:03:10]

DOCTOR: Have you noticed any actual symptoms besides tightness? Anything like shortness of breath, dizziness, or pain that spreads?

PATIENT: No, nothing like that. It’s just this pressure or tight feeling, and sometimes my heart feels like it’s fluttering for a second. But again… every time it happens, I immediately think it’s something dangerous, even though logically I know the tests were normal. (pause) I think what bothers me most is that I can’t tell what’s a real limit and what’s just stress messing with me.

DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern. We can work through that.

PATIENT: Yeah. And part of me feels guilty that I can’t just handle everything. I feel like I should be able to, you know? I’m trying to figure out what’s an actual boundary I should respect — like what I genuinely can’t push past — and what’s just me needing better coping strategies. And I keep running into those same questions: what’s a real limit, what’s not, and what do I need to actually slow down instead of powering through? [00:04:00]

DOCTOR: These are important distinctions, and they’re not easy to figure out on your own.

PATIENT: Right. And I don’t want to keep living like this — constantly checking my heart rate, constantly wondering if I’m one stressful moment away from something going wrong. It’s exhausting. (pause) But at the same time, I know pushing harder isn’t the answer either. I just don’t know how to find that balance. [00:05:16]
