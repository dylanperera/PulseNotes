DOCTOR: Alright, it’s been a few weeks since we last checked in. How have things been?

PATIENT: Honestly… it’s been rough. I’ve been trying to follow what you said about not obsessively tracking my heart rate, and I really did cut back at first. But over the last couple of weeks I slipped back into checking it a few times a day. Not constantly, but enough that I notice it’s becoming a habit again. (pause) It’s like the less control I feel at work, the more I rely on the numbers to tell me I’m “okay.” [00:01:00]

DOCTOR: What’s been happening at work recently?

PATIENT: Workload just keeps piling up. I’m covering for someone who’s off on leave, and my manager keeps saying it’s temporary, but it’s already been six weeks. And every time I try to take a break or even slow down, that tightness in my chest comes back and I get worried I’m pushing too hard. (pause) It’s this strange loop — the more overwhelmed I am, the more I focus on my heart; the more I focus on my heart, the more overwhelmed I feel.

DOCTOR: How would you describe the chest tightness?

PATIENT: It’s not pain. More like pressure, right here—(gestures)—almost like someone put a hand on my chest and is pressing gently. It’s worse at the end of the day. Sometimes I get a little fluttering too. It doesn’t last long, maybe a second or two. But every time it happens, it scares me even though I know my tests were normal. [00:02:00]

DOCTOR: Any shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea?

PATIENT: No, none of that. Just the pressure and the fluttering. But the thing is… when I’m distracted or really engaged in something, I barely notice it. On the weekend when we took the kids to the park, I didn’t feel it at all. But then Monday morning hits, and boom — I’m hyper-aware again. (pause) It makes me feel like I can’t trust my own body.

DOCTOR: That pattern actually tells us a lot. How have you been sleeping?

PATIENT: Badly. I fall asleep fine, but I wake up around 3 or 4am and my mind is just racing. And once I start thinking about work or my heart, that’s it — I’m up for an hour or two. Then I finally fall back asleep, and when my alarm goes off I feel like I didn’t sleep at all. [00:03:00]

DOCTOR: Do the chest sensations happen at night too?

PATIENT: Sometimes when I’m trying to fall back asleep. Not during the night itself — it’s more the struggle of trying to drift off again that triggers it. And I keep thinking, “What if I’m ignoring a real problem? What if it’s not stress and I’m missing something important?” I know that sounds irrational because you didn’t find anything concerning on the ECG or bloodwork. But it’s hard to shake that fear.

DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable. Fear doesn’t always respond to logic.

PATIENT: Right… and then during the day, I try to power through everything because I don’t want to fall behind at work and I don’t want to worry my family. But powering through just leaves me exhausted. (pause) My partner keeps telling me to take things off my plate, but every time they offer to help, I end up feeling guilty or annoyed, and I’m not even sure why. It’s like I’m frustrated that I even need help. [00:04:00]

DOCTOR: That often happens when people feel like they’re stretched too thin for too long.

PATIENT: Yeah… and the weird part is, I feel like I handle things better in crisis mode. When there’s a clear emergency or a deadline that’s impossible to ignore, I can deal with it. No problem. But when things are “fine,” that’s when the anxiety creeps in. That’s when I feel the heart stuff more, when my mind spirals, when everything else bothers me. (pause) It’s like calm moments highlight that something’s off with me.

DOCTOR: That’s a very insightful observation. What about physical activity? Any walks or exercise lately?

PATIENT: I’ve been trying to walk after dinner. Some nights it helps — I feel my chest loosen up, my breathing gets steadier. But other nights, I’m so tired from the day that I can barely get myself outside. And then I feel guilty again because I know the exercise would help but I can’t force myself. (pause) It’s like I’m fighting myself constantly. [00:05:00]

DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re hitting the edges of your limits but haven’t had a chance to figure out which limits are physical and which are emotional.

PATIENT: Exactly. I keep asking myself: what’s a real limit? What’s just burnout? What’s me being too hard on myself? And what’s actually my body saying, “Hey, slow down”? I don’t want to ignore symptoms if they’re meaningful, but I also don’t want to live in fear of my own heartbeat. (pause) I feel like I’m stuck between pushing too hard and pulling back too much. [00:06:00]

DOCTOR: Has anything outside of work been contributing to the stress?

PATIENT: Definitely. My dad’s been having some health problems — nothing urgent, but enough that I’m the one coordinating appointments and driving him around. And financially we’re juggling a few things too. It’s just… a lot all at once. And I can feel my body responding to it even on days when I think I’m coping fine. (pause) Then the chest tightness hits and I go, “Okay, maybe I’m not coping as well as I thought.” [00:07:00]

DOCTOR: Have you talked to anyone else about all of this — a counselor, therapist, anyone like that?

PATIENT: Not yet. I keep telling myself I don’t have time. Which I know is a terrible excuse. I keep thinking, “When things slow down, I’ll consider it,” but things never slow down. And at the same time, I’m scared they’ll say exactly what I’m afraid of: that I’m burning out and need to make big changes I don’t think I can handle right now. [00:08:00]

DOCTOR: Making changes doesn’t have to be all at once.

PATIENT: I know… but even small changes feel overwhelming. I feel like if I stop pushing, everything will fall apart. But if I keep pushing, I’m going to make myself sick. (pause) I want to trust that my heart is okay — that this is stress and not something worse — but when you’re exhausted and your chest feels tight, it’s hard to be objective. It’s hard to know what’s too much and what’s manageable. [00:09:00]

DOCTOR: That balance is something we can work on together.

PATIENT: I’d really appreciate that. I just want to understand what’s real and what’s not… what’s an actual signal my body’s giving me and what’s just the stress talking. Because right now, everything feels mixed up. And I’m hitting these limits — or what I think are limits — and I don’t know how to interpret them. [00:10:00]
