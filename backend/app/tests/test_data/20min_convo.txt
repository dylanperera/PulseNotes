DOCTOR: Thanks for coming in today. Last time we talked about stress, chest sensations, and exhaustion. How have things been since then?

PATIENT: Uh… honestly, not great. I keep trying to follow what we talked about, but things keep piling up. The chest pressure comes and goes, and the fluttering is still happening. Maybe a couple times a day. And the fatigue is getting worse. Like — not just tired — it’s this deep exhaustion. Even small things feel like a lot. [00:01:00]

DOCTOR: Let’s go through it piece by piece. How often are you noticing the chest pressure now?

PATIENT: Most days. Usually late afternoon. That’s when work is the most chaotic. Emails, meetings, unexpected stuff. And the pressure isn’t painful — it’s just tightness, like someone’s got a hand pressed lightly against my chest. And even though you told me everything looked normal last time, I can’t stop worrying that I’m missing something. [00:02:00]

DOCTOR: Is it happening during physical activity?

PATIENT: Actually… no. When I’m active, I feel fine. Hiking, walking, even carrying groceries — nothing. That’s what confuses me. If it was something serious with my heart, wouldn’t it show up then? But it’s always during stress or when I’m mentally drained.

DOCTOR: That’s helpful information. And the fluttering?

PATIENT: Yeah, like a skipped beat. Really quick. It doesn’t hurt. But it scares me every time. It’s like someone flicks a switch in my chest and suddenly I’m hyper-focused on my heartbeat. And then I think, “Is this dangerous? Is this the start of something worse?” [00:03:00]

DOCTOR: And this happens even though you know the previous tests were normal?

PATIENT: Exactly. Logically I know none of the tests showed anything, but the fear hits first. Then I try to calm myself down, but sometimes that just makes it worse. (pause) Especially when I feel overwhelmed.

DOCTOR: Tell me how things have been at work.

PATIENT: Work’s a mess. I’m covering for someone who’s out, and the workload doubled. They keep saying it’s temporary, but it’s been almost two months. And I can’t say no — because I feel like if I don’t do it, everything will fall apart. So, I push through. And then the chest tightness hits, and I wonder if I’m pushing too hard. [00:04:00]

DOCTOR: Do you feel pressure to hold everything together?

PATIENT: Constantly. There’s this sense that if I slow down, something bad will happen. And at home it’s the same — I’m trying to take care of the kids, help my parents, keep the house running. My partner tries to help, but I push them away without meaning to. Then I feel guilty. And that guilt becomes another source of stress.

DOCTOR: How so?

PATIENT: I keep thinking I should be able to handle all of this. I’ve always been able to. I’ve always been the person who can do everything. And now… even basic stuff feels heavy. And admitting that feels like failing. [00:05:00]

DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly difficult to carry alone.

PATIENT: It is. And the worst part is: when I finally get a quiet moment, instead of relaxing, my brain starts spinning. That’s when I notice every little sensation in my chest. It’s like stress makes the symptoms happen, and silence makes me focus on them.

DOCTOR: What about your sleep?

PATIENT: Still terrible. I fall asleep okay, but I wake up between 2 and 4am almost every night. And it’s like someone flipped a switch and all the worries flood in. Work deadlines, my parents’ health, my heart, everything. Sometimes I stay awake for hours. Sometimes I eventually drift back off. But I’m always exhausted in the morning. [00:06:00]

DOCTOR: Do you feel rested at all?

PATIENT: No. Even on weekends. Even when I sleep in, it’s like the exhaustion doesn’t reset. And that makes everything else harder — concentration, patience, regulating how I react to things.

DOCTOR: How has this been affecting your mood?

PATIENT: I’m… irritable. I snap more easily. Then I feel awful about it. I withdraw sometimes because I don’t want to unload on my partner or the kids. I feel guilty a lot of the time — like I’m not doing enough or being enough. [00:07:00]

DOCTOR: That’s a heavy emotional load.

PATIENT: Yeah. And it all loops back into the physical stuff. The tightness, the fatigue. And when that happens, my mind jumps to the worst-case scenario. Even though I know it’s probably stress. But I keep thinking, “What if this time it’s not just stress? What if I’m ignoring a real limit?” [00:08:00]

DOCTOR: What do you think scares you the most?

PATIENT: Losing control. If I can’t rely on my own body, or if I can’t handle what I used to handle, what does that mean? What does that say about me?

(pause)

And the idea that I might push too hard and miss something serious — that terrifies me. But slowing down terrifies me too. It feels like choosing between falling behind or falling apart. [00:09:00]

DOCTOR: Those are understandable fears. You’ve been under prolonged stress.

PATIENT: Yeah, and the thing is, when something urgent happens, I cope fine. If my kid gets hurt, or there’s a tight deadline, or someone needs help — I’m on it. Functional. Focused. But when things calm down, that’s when everything hits me. That’s when I feel the chest tightness the most. It’s like my body holds it together during crises and then collapses afterward.

DOCTOR: That’s a common stress pattern.

PATIENT: I know. But it makes me feel… defective. Like I can only function in emergencies and not in normal life. [00:10:00]

DOCTOR: What about physical activity — does that help?

PATIENT: Yes and no. When I go for walks, it usually helps. But lately I’ve been too tired after work. I’ll think about putting on my shoes and I just… can’t. The thought of one more task feels overwhelming. (pause) Then I feel guilty for not exercising, because I know it helps the stress and the heart stuff. It’s like failing twice — not doing it, and feeling bad about not doing it.

DOCTOR: What do weekends look like for you?

PATIENT: Busy. Errands, family stuff, helping my parents. It doesn’t feel like rest. Even if I sit down, there’s always something waiting for me. And when I finally get a quiet moment, my mind goes back to work, or symptoms, or responsibilities. Relaxing feels foreign. [00:11:00]

DOCTOR: Do you see any opportunities for support?

PATIENT: My partner offers. A lot. But I have trouble accepting it. It makes me feel like I’m not doing enough. And at work, asking for help feels like admitting weakness. So I keep carrying everything. Even when I shouldn’t. [00:12:00]

DOCTOR: You mentioned before wanting to distinguish between “real limits” and “stress limits.” Tell me more about that.

PATIENT: Yeah. I keep trying to figure out which things are actual boundaries my body is setting — like, things I genuinely can’t push past — and which things are just burnout or anxiety distorting everything. Because I don’t want to ignore a real signal. But I also don’t want to misinterpret normal stress and live in fear of my own body. [00:13:00]

DOCTOR: That’s a very insightful distinction.

PATIENT: I wish it felt clearer. Right now everything blends together. Sometimes I think, “Okay, I’m exhausted — respect that.” Other times I think, “Push through, you’re just stressed.” And I have no idea which is the right one. It’s like trying to drive with fogged-up windows. [00:14:00]

DOCTOR: Do you ever feel like your body and mind are pulling in different directions?

PATIENT: Constantly. My body says stop. My mind says keep going. Then my body gets louder — tightness, flutters, fatigue — and my mind panics. And I don’t know how to interpret any of it. It feels like I’m negotiating with myself every single day. Sometimes every hour. [00:15:00]

DOCTOR: What do you think you need right now?

PATIENT: I need clarity. I need to know what’s dangerous and what’s just stress. I need a way to set boundaries that doesn’t make me feel like I’m failing everyone. And I need to stop feeling like I’m constantly one step away from burnout or a health scare. [00:16:00]

DOCTOR: Those are all very reasonable goals. We can work through this systematically.

PATIENT: I hope so. Because I’m tired of guessing. I’m tired of feeling like I’m reading my body wrong. I’m tired of this cycle where stress causes symptoms, symptoms cause fear, fear creates more stress… and around it goes. (pause) I want to feel steady again. I want to feel like myself. [00:17:00]

DOCTOR: And we’ll build a plan around that.

PATIENT: Thank you. I know it’s going to take time, but I can’t keep going like this. I need to understand what’s real and what’s not — what’s a boundary, what’s burnout — and how to live without constantly fearing the next symptom. [00:18:00]

DOCTOR: We’ll take this one step at a time.

PATIENT: I’d appreciate that. Because right now, everything feels like too much. And I’m ready to start untangling it. I just don’t know how to do it alone. [00:19:00]

DOCTOR: You don’t have to. We’ll work through it together.

PATIENT: Thank you. That means a lot. I just want to feel grounded again. And I’m hoping… this is the start of getting there. [00:20:00]
