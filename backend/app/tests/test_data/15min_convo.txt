DOCTOR: Alright, thanks for waiting. What would you like to focus on today?

PATIENT: I think I need to talk about the chest stuff again — the pressure, the, uh… fluttering. And just how drained I’ve been feeling. I know we’ve talked about stress being a big factor, but things haven’t really settled down, and honestly I’m starting to worry again. [00:01:00]

DOCTOR: Tell me more about what’s been going on since your last visit.

PATIENT: Well, after our last appointment I tried to stick to the plan — less heart-rate checking, more structure in my evenings, better sleep hygiene. And for the first week or so it really helped. But then work got chaotic again. We’re understaffed, and I’ve been taking on extra responsibilities. (pause) And the tightness started coming back most afternoons. Not painful, just… heavy. Like something sitting on my chest.

DOCTOR: Does anything bring the sensation on?

PATIENT: Usually stress. If I’m in back-to-back meetings or dealing with difficult deadlines, it shows up. Sometimes after eating lunch, too — which freaks me out even more because then I start thinking, “Is this my heart? Is something wrong?” I know you said my ECG was normal, but it’s hard to shake the fear. [00:02:00]

DOCTOR: That’s understandable. How about the fluttering you mentioned?

PATIENT: Yeah, that little “blip” feeling. It happens maybe once or twice a day. It’s super quick. Like a skipped beat. It doesn’t hurt, but it gets my attention every single time. (pause) And the weird thing is that when I’m really busy or distracted, I hardly notice anything. But when I sit still or try to relax, that’s when all the sensations come forward.

DOCTOR: That’s a pretty common pattern with stress-related symptoms.

PATIENT: That’s what I keep telling myself, but my brain goes straight to: “Okay, but what if THIS time it’s something serious?” [00:03:00]

DOCTOR: What about sleep — any changes?

PATIENT: Actually worse. I fall asleep fine, but I’ve been waking up super early — like 3am, sometimes 2:30 — with my mind racing. And once I wake up, it’s really hard to fall back asleep. I’ll start thinking about work, my parents, the kids, my heart… everything. By the time I get tired again, it’s almost time to get up. (pause) And I’ve been feeling exhausted during the day. Like, bone-deep tired.

DOCTOR: And how does that tiredness affect your day?

PATIENT: Oh, it hits everything. Concentration, mood, productivity. I get irritable so easily now, even at home. My partner will ask me something simple and I’ll snap without meaning to. Then I feel guilty, and that guilt just adds to the stress. [00:04:00]

DOCTOR: How’s the support at home?

PATIENT: Pretty good, honestly. My partner’s been trying to help, but I’m not great at accepting help. I’ll say “I’m fine,” then get frustrated when things pile up. (pause) I do this thing where I try to take care of everyone — the kids, my parents, the house — even when I’m already stretched thin. And when my partner steps in, I feel… inadequate? Or like I shouldn’t need the help in the first place.

DOCTOR: That sounds like a very heavy load.

PATIENT: Yeah. And then the chest tightness hits and I can’t tell if it’s because I’m overwhelmed or because something is actually wrong. [00:05:00]

DOCTOR: Outside of work and family things, anything else going on?

PATIENT: My dad’s been having mobility issues lately. Nothing urgent, but enough that I’m the one coordinating appointments and helping him with things. And every time I worry about his health, I start thinking about my own. Like, “What if my heart is failing early? What if I’m missing the signs?” (pause) It’s exhausting to live like that.

DOCTOR: Have the symptoms ever stopped you from doing anything?

PATIENT: Not really. I still walk, I still do errands, I still take care of the kids. If anything, being active helps. When we went hiking last weekend, I felt completely fine. No tightness, no fluttering. It’s mostly on workdays or in the evenings when I’m mentally drained. [00:06:00]

DOCTOR: That’s important — your symptoms seem linked more to mental and emotional stress than physical exertion.

PATIENT: Yeah, but my brain goes, “What if I just got lucky those days?” It’s like I’m constantly second-guessing my own body. And every time something feels off, even for a second, it pulls me right back into fear mode.

DOCTOR: Have you ever had a moment where the symptoms felt truly dangerous?

PATIENT: No, not really. It’s never been sharp pain or severe pressure. Just lingering discomfort and those occasional flutters. But emotionally? It feels dangerous. That fear response pops up instantly. [00:07:00]

DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re describing a cycle — stress triggers physical symptoms, symptoms trigger fear, fear adds more stress, and the loop continues.

PATIENT: Exactly. It’s like I’m stuck in this loop where I can’t tell the difference between stress and something real. And the more tired I get, the worse it gets. (pause) My partner keeps telling me to talk to someone — like counseling — but I keep waiting for things to “calm down,” and they just don’t. I know I need more help, but taking that first step feels overwhelming.

DOCTOR: What do you think is holding you back?

PATIENT: Honestly? Fear that someone will tell me I need to make big life changes — change jobs, reduce workload, delegate more. And I don’t feel like I can. We rely on my income. Work needs me. My family needs me. I can’t just drop everything. [00:08:00]

DOCTOR: It doesn’t have to be all-or-nothing.

PATIENT: I know, but small changes feel impossible too. Even setting boundaries at work feels like admitting I can’t handle what I used to handle. (pause) And I keep thinking, “Maybe if I just push a little harder, I’ll catch up and things will settle down.” But they never do. It’s like running on a treadmill that keeps speeding up. [00:09:00]

DOCTOR: That’s a powerful metaphor. Do you ever get time to yourself?

PATIENT: Rarely. I mean, I technically have time, but it doesn’t feel like rest. Even when I sit down, I’m thinking of the next thing I have to do. I’ve forgotten what it feels like to actually relax without feeling guilty or anxious.

DOCTOR: And how does all of this affect your relationship with your own body?

PATIENT: I feel like my body is warning me, but I can’t interpret the signals correctly. Like I’m out of sync with myself. And the more it happens, the more I don’t trust myself. (pause) It feels like I’m constantly hitting these limits but I don’t know if they’re real limits or just burnout shouting at me. [00:10:00]

DOCTOR: Do you think you're afraid of what slowing down might reveal?

PATIENT: Yeah. If I slow down, I have to actually feel everything. The exhaustion, the stress, the grief, the pressure. It’s easier to keep moving than to face all of that. But then the physical stuff hits and I’m forced to stop anyway. (pause) It’s like my body is negotiating with me: “If you won’t slow down, I’ll make you.” [00:11:00]

DOCTOR: That’s a very insightful way to put it.

PATIENT: I guess. I just want to know what limits are real. Like — what’s an actual sign that I’m pushing too hard, and what’s just anxiety twisting things around? I don’t want to ignore something serious, but I also don’t want to live my life afraid of my own heartbeat. [00:12:00]

DOCTOR: Those concerns are valid. And part of our job together is distinguishing which sensations require medical follow-up and which are stress-driven.

PATIENT: That would help a lot. Because right now, everything blends together. The tiredness, the chest tightness, the worry, the responsibilities… it all blurs. (pause) And I keep thinking, “What do I push through, and what do I respect as a boundary?” [00:13:00]

DOCTOR: We can work on building a clearer framework for that.

PATIENT: I’d appreciate that. I’m at the point where I feel like I’m juggling too many things, and every new symptom — even minor — feels like another ball I can’t afford to drop. I want to feel steady again. I want to feel like myself. [00:14:00]

DOCTOR: We're going to figure that out together.

PATIENT: Thank you. I really need that. I need a clearer sense of what’s real and what’s not — what’s stress, what’s physical — and how to set limits that don’t make me feel like I’m failing. Because right now, I’m not sure I know the difference. [00:15:00]
